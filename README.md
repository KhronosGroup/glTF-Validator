# glTF-Validator
Tool to validate [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) assets.

Validation is performed against [glTF 1.0.1 draft](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/1.0.1/specification) with `asset.version` check disabled.

Validator outputs a validation report (in JSON-format) with all found issues and asset stats.

Live drag-n-drop tool (beta): http://github.khronos.org/glTF-Validator
 
## Implemented features

- JSON syntax check
- All properties and their types from JSON schemas (including limitations on valid values).
- Validity of internal `id` references.
- Object-specific checks (compatibility of interlinked dictionaries, property combinations, etc).
- Correctness of `Data URI` encoding.
- `.glb` file format from [`KHR_binary_gltf`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/Khronos/KHR_binary_glTF) extension.
